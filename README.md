# Banner Auto Register (BAR)
#### Disclaimer: This tool was created solely for testing purposes. If you are prohibited from using software to automatically register for courses, do not use this software. I am not responsible for anything that goes wrong.

### Automatically register for your next semester's classes with this tool!
BAR accomplishes a few tasks so human error doesn't slow down the registration process:
- Takes in a PIN that is autofilled when prompted by the site
- Refreshes the waiting screen at random intervals between 1 and 10 seconds
- Begins to load the registration page with millisecond precision
- Instantly loads CRNs into the page and submits the form
- Stores a temporary cookie to stop the script after first run

You must be familiar with a few things before continuing:
- JavaScript - adding your information to a few lines in the code
- Chrome extensions - downloading and setting up the code injector

## Getting Started
Make sure you have the following things:
- Chromium-based browser
  - this includes Chrome, Edge, Brave, Opera, or anywhere else where you can download the required extension
- A working internet connection (ethernet is recommended)
- 10 minutes to set up the tool
